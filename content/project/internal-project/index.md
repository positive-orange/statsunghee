summary: We propose a new framework of envelope block-wise imputation (EBI) to address block-wise missingness. The proposed method considers canonical correlations of multi-source data and impute the missing parts by estimating canonical correlations.

Assume that two data sets are partially overlapped into the common samples $X_{k}^{c}, k=1,2$. Then, the unique and missing parts are denoted as $X_{k}^{u}$ and $X_{k}^{\star}, \enspace k=1,2$. Under the Simultaneous Envelope structure,
