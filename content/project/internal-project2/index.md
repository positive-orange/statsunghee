summary: Here, we focus on the sex differences in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) mechanics by applying a modification of the generalized liquid association (GLA) method to determine simultaneously (sparse) linear combinations of the TMJ skull and muscle measurements that exhibit a maximal difference in association by sex.

## Motivation

* A vastly studied in a well-known method called canonical correlation analysis (CCA) probes the dependency of two multivariate random variables and extracts canonical pairs of highly correlated linear combinations.
* However, the correlation only captures increasing or decreasing trends quantiﬁed to correlation coefficients.
* To capture the dependence structure between two variables conditioned on the third set of random variables, Li (2002) proposed a liquid association (LA).
* An extended version of LA so-called generalized liquid association (Li et al. 2021) method captures how different data modalities associate and interact with each other.
* We figure out the effects of sexual dimorphism on **temporomandibular joint (TMJ)** muscle attachment.
* We apply a **modiﬁcation of the generalized liquid association (GLA) method** to determine simultaneously (sparse) linear combinations of the TMJ skull and muscle measurements that exhibit a maximal difference in association by sex.
