Correspondence analysis is a method of data analysis for representing tabulated data graphically. Moreover, the modified Andrews curve provides correspondent relationships among categories in each variable. It performs clustering on the row, and column levels are one of the solutions for sparse data. 

* In this study, we first review the previous theory of correspondence analysis. 
* Then, we focus on dimension reduction and visualization techniques on the correspondence analysis. 
* Also, we display symmetric and asymmetric plots as an exploratory data analysis and use a modified Andrews curve to know more relationships among categories. 
* Finally, we use Ward clustering to reduce the number of categories of each variable on the contingency table. 
* The 3rd Korean working conditions survey(KWCS) data is used for the real analysis.
